# Creation of a shell similar to bash

## A shell is a type of computer program called a command-line interpreter that lets Linux and Unix users control their operating systems with command-line interfaces
In this project i created a program that works exactly like a shell. Basically by giving commands to the command line the shell works accordingly.
